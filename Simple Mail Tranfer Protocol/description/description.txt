Simple Mail Transfer Protocol:
- Implementation of a part of the SMTP protocol as described in RFC 5321.

SMTP as a Scribble/Session protocol:
- The SMTP protocol is a text protocol that uses TCP connection.
  We show that a text protocol like SMTP can be described in Scribble.
  The Scribble protocol is used to implement SMTP in Mungo and LICS
- The implementation requires a layer for translating session messages, which
  the client format, from/to text messages, which is the server format

Mungo implementation:
- The Mungo implementation uses the Scribble to Mungo tool to derive
  local typestate protocols for each participant implemented (in this
  case the SMTP Client)
- The Mungo Client is tested against the gmail server

LICS implementation:
- The LICS implementation implements both the client and the server
