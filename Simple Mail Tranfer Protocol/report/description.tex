\section{Description}

In this report we describe the implementation of
an application layer communication protocol.
The protocol specifies an interaction between
an Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) client and a \lstinline|gmail| server.
The protocol is defined using global session types.

{SMTP} is an internet standard
electronic mail transfer protocol which typically runs over a TCP
(Transmission Control Protocol) connection.
It was first defined in RFC
821~\cite{SMTP-rfc} and later extended in RFC 5321~\cite{ESMTP-rfc},
which is the version we consider here.
%

An SMTP interaction consists of an exchange of text-based {commands}
between the client and the server.
For example, the client sends the
\lstinline|EHLO| command to identify itself and open the connection with
the server.
%
The commands \lstinline|MAIL FROM| : $<$address$>$ and \lstinline|RCPT TO| : $<$address$>$
specify the e-mail address of the sender and the
receiver of the e-mail.
%
The \lstinline|DATA| command allows the client to specify the text of
the e-mail. The \lstinline|QUIT| command is used to terminate the
session and close the connection. The responses from the server have the
following format: three digits followed by an optional dash ``-'', such
as \lstinline|250-|, and then some text, like OK. The server might reply
to \lstinline|EHLO| with \lstinline|250| $<$text$>$ or to
\lstinline|MAIL FROM| or \lstinline|RCPT TO| with \lstinline|250| OK.
