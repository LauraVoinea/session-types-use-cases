\section{Scribble Protocol}

\paragraph{Global Protocol}
We give the Scribble protocol, that formally specifies the
global communication as described in \secref{subsec:algorithm}.
%
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Global Protocol}]
global protocol Fibonacci(role A, role B) {
  rec Fib {
    choice at A {
      fibonacci(long) from A to B;
      fibonacci(long) from B to A;
      continue Fib;
    } or {
      end() from A to B;
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above protocol starts by declaring a recursive block
with recursive variable \lstinline|Fib|.
Inside the recursion role $A$ decides whether to send
a \lstinline|long| integer (Java primitive data-type)
to role $B$ or send an \lstinline|end| to role $B$.
In the former case role's $A$ message will be followed
by role $B$ sending a \lstinline|long| integer. The protocol
then performs a recursion on the recursive variable.
In role's $A$ latter choice the protocol terminates.

\paragraph{Local projection}
The global protocol is used to project the communication
behaviour of roles $A$ and B.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Local Protocol for Role A}]
local protocol Fibonacci at A(role A, role B) {
  rec Fib {
    choice at A {
      fibonacci(long) to B;
      fibonacci(long) from B;
      continue Fib;
    } or {
      end() to B;
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The code above describes the global protocol from role's $A$
point of view. It give the exact communication actions that
role $A$ needs to do in order to respect the global protocol.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Local Protocol for Role B}]
local protocol Fibonacci at B(role A, role B) {
  rec Fib {
    choice at A {
      fibonacci(long) from A;
      fibonacci(long) to A;
      continue Fib;
    } or {
      end() from A;
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Dually, the code above describes the global protocol from
the point of view of role $B$. Role $B$ needs to perform
the dual communication actions with respect to role $A$
in order to respect the global protocol.
