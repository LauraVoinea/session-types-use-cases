A demo that Dimitris presented in the CoCoPOPS event 9/6/2015.

It presents a protocol for a collection data structure.
The protocol has 4 states:
- Init: only initialise method can be called to initialise the collection
- Empty: an empty state cannot allow a get method
- NonEmpty: an non empty state can allow a get and a put method
- Unknown: in the unknown state an isEmpty method call decides the next state (Empty or nonEmpty)

The implementation of the collection protocol is done using a stack data structure.

Then two StackUsers demonstrate the basic features of mungo such as:
- local variable type inference
- protocol unfolding
- argument passing
- return values
- type field type inference

Note the recursion structures that are implemented using a compination
of a nested switch inside a labelled do while statement.
