Bookstore:
- A basic communication protocol that describes a multiparty
  session protocol.

The protocol:
- Buyer 1 selects a book and it is informed for its price from the book Seller
- Buyer 1 then quotes a contribution to Buyer 2.
- If Buyer 2 agrees on the purchase, both buyers send their contribution to
  the Seller to buy the book.
- On a different case the protocol terminates

Implementation (Current Implementations):
- Mungo (shared memory interface)
  A main method is responsible for running all the objects in the protocol

- Mungo (socket interface)
  A distributed execution of three processes that implement the roles of the
  protocol and exchange protocol messages via sockets
