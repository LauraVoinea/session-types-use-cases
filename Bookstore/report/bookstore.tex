\section{Description}

In this report we describe the implementation of
an application layer communication protocol.
The protocol specifies an interaction between
two online Buyers that invoke a process of
buying a book from an online Seller.
The protocol is defined using global session types.

\subsection{Bookstore Scenario}
\label{subsec:description}

The communication interaction takes place between two Buyers,
role \BuyerOne and role \BuyerTwo, and a Seller,
role \Seller:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
			\BuyerOne initiates the interaction
			by choosing and sending a book title to \Seller,
			and asking for the price of the book.

	\item
			The \Seller then checks its database and
			responds to \BuyerOne with a price for the book.

	\item
			\BuyerOne calculates and
			sends a contribution quote to
			\BuyerTwo in order to request to
			share the expenses for the book.

	\item
			\BuyerTwo then decides, depending on
			the contribution, and
			either agrees to contribute
			to the buy or not. In both
			cases it informs both \BuyerOne
			and the \Seller.

	\item
			In the former decision \BuyerOne
			sends its contribution to the \Seller
			followed by \BuyerTwo sending its
			contribution to the \Seller.
%			The \Seller then dispatches the book.

	\item
			In the latter decision of \BuyerTwo
			the protocol terminates.
\end{enumerate}
