Two distributed HelloWorld protocols for Mungo.
Both protocols are described in global types/scribble.

Two party protocol:
- Bob says hi to Alice and then decides whether he will ask Alice the time or not.
  Alice respond according to the choice of Bob.

Three party protocol:
- Bob says hi to Alice and Carol and then decides who to ask for the time.
  Alice or Carol respond according to the choice of Bob.

Implementation:
- All the participants are distributed over java threads and use sockects
  to coordinate.

Demonstrates the robustness of mungo implementation when dealing with
distributed java resources.
