This problem involves **n** smokers and one arbiter. The arbiter
puts resources on the table and smokers pick them. A smoker needs to
collect **k** resources to start smoking. The challenge is to avoid
deadlock by disallowing a competition between smokers 
from picking up resources. This is done by delegating the control to the arbiter, who decidess (in
a random manner) which smoker shoudl be given the resource.
